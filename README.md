# Hi 👋, I'm Shreekrushanaprasad Mane

🚀 **Python & Java Backend Developer** | Passionate about building efficient, scalable, and robust backend systems

As a skilled backend developer, I specialize in **Python (Django, FastAPI), Java (Spring Boot)**, and microservice architecture. I love designing system architectures, implementing asynchronous tasks, and optimizing performance using tools like **Redis, Celery**, and **Kafka**. From REST APIs to full-stack platforms, I build solutions that make an impact.
